    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Spaghetti recipe is elevated because the meatballs are made with 100% real love. It's a step harder
        than your typical ground beef sauce, but if you can get the three essential elements 
        correct: tomato sauce, meatballs, and premium pasta, than it will be worthwhile. If 
        you cannot get the specific brands, any generic brand could work. 
    </p>
    <p>The order to cook the recipe should be meatballs, sauce, and pasta last. This ensures
        every ingredient comes out warm and aromatic for serving.
    </p>
    <p>This makes 4 servings</p>

    <ul><li>One 32oz Can of Cento Crushed Tomatos</li></ul>
    <ul><li>1 lb of Ground Beef 80/20 Blend</li></ul>
    <ul><li>1/4-1/2 Pound of Bologne, Ham, or Pruschotto</li></ul>
    <ul><li>1/4 cup of Panko Bread Crumbs</li></ul>
    <ul><li>1 Teaspoon of Crushed Fennel Seeds</li></ul>
    <ul><li>1 Egg</li></ul>
    <ul><li>1/4 cup of Grated Parmesan Cheese</li></ul>
    <ul><li>6 Minced Cloves of Garlic</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Any oil</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Kosher Salt</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Pepper Flakes</li></ul>
    <ul><li>Pepper</li></ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, mix the ground beef, bologne, bread crumbs, fennel seeds,
        half your minced garlic, 1 egg, and 1 teaspoon of salt and some pepper to taste.</li>
    
    <li>Mix into a jiggly giant meatball, slap it a few times, and then divide into golf
        sized meatballs.</li>
   
    <li>Cover the bottom of a large skillet with oil on medium high. Brown at least the top
        and bottom of the meatballs for a couple of minutes. Grab the meatballs out of the 
        pan. They will be uncooked on the inside still. Turn the heat down to medium low.
        There should still be oil in the pan.</li>
    
    <li>With the remaining meatball oil in the pan throw in pepper flakes, and garlic, let
        it sizzle for 15 seconds and then pour in your can of crushed tomato. Let it come 
        up to a light boil. (It always pops! So grab a lid and be prepared to turn heat down)
        Pour in the meatballs, and boil both the sauce and meatballs for 10 minutes. Or 
        continue cooking on low to mesh those flavors together. Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    
    <li>Heavily salt a pot of water and boil your pasta until al dente, or 30 seconds
        before manufacturing recommmendations usually. </li>
    <li>
    Take the pasta and mix it into the sauce and meatballs. Dish up the 
    pasta and sauce together and shred some parmesan on top.</li>
