    I ripped this recipe off of a guy on Youtube. It's a great recipe because it takes less than
    15 minutes total, <em>including prep time.</em>
    <p>Let's start. Shall we?</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken (literally any amount) </li>
        <li>Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Any seasoning (try old bay!)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>
    Lightly season the chicken with kosher salt and other seasonings.
    </li>
    <li>
    Cover the chicken in mayonnaise. Thin coat is fine, usually no more than a tablespoon per half pound.
    </li>
    <li>
    Put the chicken into a prewarmed skillet on medium high. Flip the chicken a couple of times to ensure an even 
    golden brown crust. Take the chicken off heat around 155&deg farenheight and let it sit for 5-10 minutes before cutting.
    </li>
    </ol>
